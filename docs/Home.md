# Welcome to the OpenTera Wiki!

## What is OpenTera?
OpenTera is a micro-services based backend primarily built to support research projects. Focusing on years in the research field, common features between the different projects emerged:

* **Data structure**: The need to store data in a structured way to ease data analysis
* **Ecological data capture**: The need to collect data not only in a laboratory or controlled environment, but also in the home
* **Project adaptability**: The need to develop projects specific dashboards while reusing as much as possible of what was done before to reduce development time
* **Security**: The need to store and transfer data in a secure and controlled way

To address those common features, OpenTera was designed with an architecture based as much as possible on recognized standards and best practices.

## What can OpenTera do for you?
In its essence, OpenTera provides an adaptable data structure on which you can base your developments. With its modular and service-based design, it is possible to tailor specific needs based on the OpenTera framework.

Applications of the OpenTera backend are not limited to research projects, and could also be applied in a clinical environment, where clinicians have to communicate with patients. Such fields include but are not limited to: tele-rehabilibation (physical, social, mental), robotic tele-operation and remote activity monitoring.
